# Foreword

Kia Ora and Welcome,

If you're reading this, you're part of a very special friend group that's getting a pre-read of my upcoming book called Buying Property in Auckland: The Guide, coming to all good bookstores and ofcourse Amazon, very soon.

I purchased my first home at 25, and fell in love with both buying houses, and the whole complicated and stressful experience that is buying a home, having learned the hard way through trial and error. Being one of the first in my friend group to do so, I spent a lot of time counselling my friends on their successful property journeys, and realizing most of what I said repeated, decided to write it all up into one big word document, this is now the final state - an entire book on the topic, so anyone that wants to buy in Auckland can come away with, hopefully a bit more knowledge.

In this book, I'll cover the main elements of buying a property from the shoes of you and I - a typical buyer in Auckland. I'm not a financial advisor, legal person, or a real estate agent. Much of what I'll say is my own hard experience, and some I will defer you to seek expert advice if you need it (because, this will be the most expensive purchase of your life so far).

Best,\
Jay
