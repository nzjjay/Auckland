Kia Ora and Welcome,

If you're reading this, you're part of a very special friend group that's getting a pre-read of my upcoming book called Buying Property in Auckland: The Guide, coming to all good bookstores and of course Amazon, very soon.

I bought my first home in my early 20s and quickly became fascinated with the entire process—complicated, stressful, and all. I learned through trial and error, and as one of the first in my friend group to buy, I often found myself guiding others through their own journeys. After repeating the same advice many times, I decided to put it all into one big document. That document has now become this book, designed to help anyone looking to buy a home in Auckland.

This book covers the key aspects of buying property from the perspective of an everyday buyer like you and me. I’m not a financial advisor, lawyer, or real estate agent—just someone sharing hard-earned experience. Where expert advice is necessary, I’ll point you in the right direction because, after all, this is likely the biggest purchase of your life so far.

Best,\
Jay
