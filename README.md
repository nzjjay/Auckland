# Welcome

Kia Ora and Welcome.

If you're looking to buy a property in Auckland, this guide is my gift to you, to help you on what can be quite a stressful and complex journey. I created this guide for myself to document my property buying journey, having learned the hard way through trial and error buying multiple properties in Auckland. Over time my friends kept asking me for advice, and so I published this mini-book to give you a comprehensive guide on buying the best property for your needs.&#x20;

Hopefully it helps you with your own property journey and give you the foundations to point you in the right direction.

Auckland has more than one million properties with incredible diversity across a large geographic area. Nearly every property is unique, and every property has a story. By understanding some of the features of property, you’ll gain a better understanding of how to find, value, and buy the property for you.

The most important thing you should take away from this booklet as you look for property is:

_**“There are no bargains in Auckland”**_

Good luck,\

## The guide

I've tried to write the guide in four sections that follow one after each other -&#x20;

1. The buying journey - starting the search and buying a house
2. Evaluating a property - What to look at when interested in a property
3. Evaluating the house itself - Some lessons around construction
4. Finance, legal, and insurance - The boring but important stuff
