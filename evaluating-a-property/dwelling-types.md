# Dwelling types

### Freestanding house

The most common type of housing – your house sits on its own piece of land with no shared walls. These homes are simple to manage because you don’t deal with shared spaces or neighbours’ decisions, and you know exactly what you own.

### Terraced Housing / Units

Terraced houses are a newer addition to Auckland, often found in developments under the Unitary Plan or in areas like Hobsonville. They’re modern, cost-effective, and low-maintenance, but you’ll share walls and sometimes driveways with neighbours. Some banks may be cautious about lending for terraced homes, and insurance can be more complex. Many come with covenants restricting things like balcony laundry or modifications to shared spaces, so check these carefully before making an offer.

### Semi-Detached dwelling

Semi-detached homes are similar to terraced houses, except usually only one wall or garage is shared with a neighbour. They tend to be cheaper than freestanding homes, but any structural changes may require consideration of shared walls. Check with your bank and insurance early, as shared access or walls may affect both.

### Apartment

As the name implies, an apartment means a defined space within an apartment building. This guide won’t focus on apartments – they’re a different class of their own. If you are set on apartments, some things to consider:

1. **Depreciation:** Apartments don't own land, they are units on a shared parcel of land. This means while the location itself may induce an appreciation of your unit, the unit itself will get older and depreciate. I am not sure there are many success stories of appreciating apartment units in Auckland.
2. **Shared services:** You have to share, and I don't like sharing. You can't control who your neighbours are, but you will have them beside, above, and below. The other issue is you may not be able to easily choose power, water, or fibre providers. If you have an EV - you may not be able to easily install a charger for example.
3. **Body corporates:** Body corporates are required by law and govern apartments. They set the rules, and you must abide by them. The fees for these are low in the first few years, but as maintenance costs increase, these costs can significantly increase too.&#x20;
