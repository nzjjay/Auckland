# Inside a property

This is all you – does it fit your flow? Does it need any renovations? Are the rooms a good size? Most properties will have staged furniture to create a perception. Imagine the room empty, plain, and hollow without the nice wooden or Ikea-style furniture – would you still like it?

Some areas of detail to pay attention to include smoke alarms, paintwork, and kitchen appliances. A home that hasn’t been well-maintained is a signal to dig deeper and check everything thoroughly.

**Insulation, ventilation, and heating**

* Check for visible insulation in the roof and walls if you can, or ask for documentation. Poor insulation can drastically affect heating costs.
* Note the location and type of heating: heat pumps, gas heaters, underfloor heating. Are they sufficient for the size of the home?
* Look at vents and airflow in bathrooms, kitchens, and bedrooms. Poor ventilation can lead to mould, dampness, and unpleasant odours.
* Test the heating system if possible – does it reach all areas comfortably?

**Doors and windows**

* Inspect for rot, warping, or sticking doors and windows, especially in older homes.
* Check the seals on double-glazed windows – condensation inside the panes can indicate they need replacing.
* Open and close every door and window to ensure smooth operation. Pay attention to squeaks, drafts, or gaps.
* Consider security: do all windows have locks? Are there any easily accessible from outside?

**Floor coverings**

* Look for scratches, chips, or other damage on wooden floors or tiles. Carpet condition matters too – stains, odours, and wear can be costly to replace.
* Check for uneven floors that could indicate structural issues.

**Electrical and gas**

* Identify the type of cooking (gas or electric) and its condition.
* Look at the switchboard: old or overloaded boards may need upgrading.
* Check if there are enough power outlets in practical locations.
* Ask about any hidden electrical work – for example, extra wiring for hot water or heat pumps.

**Plumbing**

* Turn on taps, showers, and toilets to check water pressure and drainage.
* Look for leaks under sinks or around toilets.
* Inspect hot water systems: type, age, and location. Some older units may be nearing the end of their lifespan.
* Ask if there have been any past plumbing issues.

**Layout**

* Walk through the flow of the home – does it suit your lifestyle?
* Note unusual entry points, like entering directly into the kitchen.
* Check for awkward bathroom placements or other design quirks that may be inconvenient.

**Storage**

* Open every cupboard and closet. Is there enough room for your belongings?
* Look at the garage, sheds, and attic space – are they functional and safe?
* Consider shared spaces (if in a townhouse or cross-lease) and any restrictions on storage.

**Appliances**

* Check ovens, cooktops, dishwashers, and laundry machines. Are they functional and in good condition?
* Note the age of appliances – older models may need replacing sooner than expected.

**Security**

* Check locks on doors and windows, and any existing alarm systems.
* Consider visibility from the street – is it very exposed or secluded?
* Ask about neighbourhood safety or recent break-ins in the area.

**Smells and dampness**

* Be wary of strong air fresheners, scented candles, or other masking smells – these can hide damp, mould, or pet odours.
* Inspect under sinks, in wardrobes, and in basements for signs of mould or water damage.
* Sniff for musty smells near windows, walls, and ceilings.

**Extra Tips for First-Time Buyers**

* Bring a notebook or use your phone to take photos and notes as you inspect each room. It’s easy to forget details when viewing multiple properties.
* Take a friend or family member along for a second opinion – they may notice things you miss.
* Don’t be rushed by the agent. Take your time to mentally live in the space.
* Consider potential renovations or upgrades you may want, and whether the property can accommodate them.
* If something seems too good to be true (cheap price, perfect condition), investigate further – there may be hidden issues.
