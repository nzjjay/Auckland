# Inside a property

This is all you – does it fit your flow? Does it need any renovations? Are the rooms a good size? Most properties will have staged furniture to create a perception. Imagine the room as being hollow and bland without the nice wooden ikea-esque furniture, would you still like it?

Some areas of detail you want to look at include smoke alarms, the paint job, and the kitchen appliances. A home with an owner that doesn’t pay much attention to their building is an invitation for you to drill a bit deeper and ensure everything is as it should be. Some things you should look for:

1. Insulation, ventilation and heating – Where are the heatpumps, and how is the venting?
2. Doors and windows – Wood or aluminum? Any squeaks or rot?
3. Floor coverings – Scratches, damage, and how do they look?
4. &#x20;Electrical and gas – What type of cooking? Does the switchboard look new?
5. &#x20;Plumbing – How are the tap fittings, bathroom fittings, etc?
6. &#x20;Layout – Do you enter through the kitchen? Is there a bathroom door on entry?
7. &#x20;Storage – Where do your duvets, etc go? What about all the junk you will never use?
8. Appliances – Do they need replacing, or are they good?
9. Security – Alarm? Is it very exposed?
10. Smells – Agents will often use scented candles, etc. Any mould smells, dampness, etc?
