# Outside a property

Work your way outside in, this lets you get a good understanding of the property, its grounds, and the surrounding area. Check the building materials, the land area, surrounding structures, slope, and anything else that may be a criterion for you.

## Orientation

The orientation of the house is quite important and not something you can easily change. **North facing** houses are generally better because of the natural sunlight that can come in. Rooms that face north will get plenty of sun while rooms that face south wont. Generally I prefer houses where the garage and bathrooms are south, and the living areas are to the north. I'm not too fussed about the bedrooms but each to their own.

## Parking

This is really dependent on your lifestyle, but Auckland remains a very car-centric city, with a third world public transport system. This means despite our hopes and your protests, you will likely need a car, or 2 for your household. The problem is the new Auckland design standards don't require consideration for off-street parking with new developments and renovations. When buying, look at the off-street parking situation carefully. Do not factor in on-road parking as these can be removed or charged for at any time, and anyone can park there.

Also consider manuvering. Is it easy to drive in, do a U-Turn, and drive out again? You don't want to be reversing on to a main road, or reversing into your driveway, every single day.&#x20;

Many homes have shared driveways. In this case, factor in what exclusive space you have for your car. Can you wash your car without blocking anyone else?

## Building

1. Building materials - Are they using high quality brands like Marley and quality fittings?
2. &#x20;Drainage, guttering, and spouting - Internal or external? Any sags, rust or issues? Plastic or metal?
3. Building exterior – Are the weatherboards lined well? Does the house look well put together?
4. Under the house – Do the piles look ok? Is there dampness? Is anything at a wrong angle?
5. Retaining walls – Is there any sagging? Is something bending that shouldn’t be?
6. Access and paths – Are they well defined and easily accessible?
7. Trees – Are there any big trees that pose a danger?
8. Shared spaces – How close are the neighbours and what do they share with you?
