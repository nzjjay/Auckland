# Unitary Plan

The Unitary Plan is a key document in Auckland's planning and zoning system. It came into effect in 2016 and provides the framework for how land in Auckland is used and developed. The plan combines the Regional Policy Statement, regional plans, and the district plan into one unified document. It aims to guide Auckland's growth and development while balancing housing needs, business activity, and environmental protection. This all sounds boring, but it has a massive influence on your property buying experience and the price you'll pay.

Key features of the Unitary Plan include:

1. **Zoning**: The plan outlines different zones for residential, business, industrial, and rural land. These zones dictate what can and can't be built on a particular piece of land. Residential zones, for instance, may allow for single dwellings or apartments, depending on the area’s development rules.
2. **Density**: The Unitary Plan enables increased housing density in some parts of Auckland, particularly in areas close to public transport hubs, like train stations and bus routes. This encourages more people to live in areas with good access to amenities.
3. **Growth Areas**: The plan identifies growth areas where development is encouraged to accommodate Auckland's expanding population. These include both greenfield sites (undeveloped land) and brownfield sites (former industrial areas).
4. **Height and Building Controls**: The plan sets out specific height limits and building standards depending on the zone and location. For example, in high-density zones like the city center, taller buildings may be allowed, while suburban zones may restrict the height of buildings to maintain the area's character.
5. **Environmental Considerations**: The Unitary Plan also incorporates environmental protections, such as preserving heritage areas, managing stormwater, and protecting key natural features like rivers, lakes, and coastal areas.
6. **Resource Consent**: If a property or development doesn't comply with the rules set out in the Unitary Plan, you may need to apply for a resource consent. This is a formal application to the Auckland Council for approval to do something that's not automatically allowed under the plan.

**Important:** If you can build in the zone, don't forget your neighbours can too. So if you buy in a THAB zone, don't expect to have the lovely 1960s house stay next to you, and be prepared for a 10 storey apartment if RCs are met.

## The **Single Housing Zone**

Single housing is a zoning classification that applies to many areas in Auckland, particularly in the central isthmus and other suburban parts of the city. These zones are designed for **low-density** residential living, which means they typically allow for one dwelling per section, making them ideal for those who prefer a quieter, more spacious lifestyle with less crowding.

#### Key Characteristics:

* **Low-Density**: In Single Housing Zones, properties are generally designed for single homes or perhaps minor units like a granny flat, but not multiple dwellings. The zoning restricts the ability to subdivide the land into smaller lots for additional homes.
* **Larger, Older Homes**: The areas within the Single Housing Zone often feature larger, older homes, sometimes with generous backyards and more green space compared to higher-density zones. These properties are often well-established and desirable due to their location, character, and surrounding environment.
* **Limited Development Potential**: One of the trade-offs in Single Housing Zones is the lack of development flexibility. If you're buying in one of these zones, you're unlikely to be able to subdivide your property or develop multiple homes on the same site. This can limit future investment potential in terms of increasing property value through development.
* **Stable Neighborhoods**: Because of the zoning rules, the neighborhoods in these zones typically remain low-density, with no sudden increases in property numbers or apartment buildings springing up around you. This can be appealing for people who value privacy, space, and a quieter atmosphere.

#### The Pros and Cons:

* **Pros**:
  * **Privacy and Space**: These areas tend to have larger sections with more outdoor space, which can be great for families, gardening, or those seeking a peaceful environment.
  * **Character Homes**: Many Single Housing Zones have older homes with more unique architectural features, adding charm to the area.
  * **Stable Neighborhood**: With less development and density, the character and nature of these neighborhoods are more likely to remain consistent over time.
* **Cons**:
  * **No Subdivision or Development**: If you're considering future-proofing your investment by developing multiple properties on your land, Single Housing Zones won’t allow that.
  * **Higher Property Prices**: Due to the desirable characteristics of these areas, properties in Single Housing Zones often come at a higher cost, which may be a barrier for some buyers.
  * **Limited Housing Supply**: As there’s no allowance for significant development, housing supply in these areas can be limited, contributing to higher demand and competition for homes.

Ultimately, Single Housing Zones are ideal for buyers who prioritize stability, a sense of community, and a more traditional residential environment, but they may not be suitable for those looking for more flexibility in terms of development opportunities.

## Mixed Suburban Zone

The **Mixed Suburban Zone** is one of the most common residential zoning types in Auckland. It is designed to accommodate a variety of residential types while also allowing for some level of intensification in suitable areas.

**Key Characteristics:**

* **Residential Use with Flexibility**: The Mixed Suburban Zone allows for a mix of residential activities, typically including **freestanding homes**, **townhouses**, and **small apartments**. It provides the flexibility for low to medium-density housing.
* **Building Height**: Typically, buildings in this zone are allowed to reach **two stories** (up to **9 meters**), though some areas may have exceptions, especially in areas marked for further development or intensification.
* **Lot Size and Density**: The minimum lot size in the Mixed Suburban Zone is typically **400m²** for standalone homes, but smaller lots are permitted for terraced housing or townhouse developments. **Intensification** is encouraged in some areas, especially near transport nodes, parks, or commercial centers.
* **Community Focus**: This zone is intended to provide a suburban feel while accommodating growth. Many neighborhoods within the Mixed Suburban Zone will have a blend of detached homes and smaller-scale multi-unit developments, leading to a community-oriented living environment.
* **Subdivision Potential**: In certain parts of the Mixed Suburban Zone, there is potential for **subdivision**. For example, properties with larger sections may be able to subdivide and build multiple dwellings, increasing housing density.
* **Intensity of Development**: The degree of intensification varies across the Mixed Suburban Zone. Some areas may experience more growth due to the development of multi-unit dwellings (such as townhouses and apartments), while others maintain a more suburban character with single-family homes.

**Pros:**

* **Variety of Housing Options**: The zone allows for a mix of housing types, making it suitable for a broad range of buyers, from those seeking detached homes to those interested in townhouses or smaller multi-unit dwellings.
* **Proximity to Amenities**: In some parts of this zone, particularly near transport or commercial hubs, you'll have good access to shops, public transport, and other amenities.
* **Potential for Subdivision**: If you're interested in the idea of subdividing in the future, properties in this zone can offer that option, provided they meet council requirements.

**Cons:**

* **Growing Density**: As the city intensifies, areas within the Mixed Suburban Zone may see increased housing density, which could impact your privacy and outdoor space, especially if new developments are built close by.
* **Limited Privacy**: The close proximity of properties, particularly with the construction of townhouses or shared driveways, can lead to less privacy compared to larger, standalone homes in suburban zones.

## Mixed Urban Zone

The **Urban Zone** is another crucial component of Auckland’s Unitary Plan, focusing on higher-density living in areas designed to accommodate growth while balancing urbanization with livability.

**Key Characteristics:**

* **High-Density Residential Development**: The **Urban Zone** is intended for **higher-density residential development**, such as apartments, terraced houses, and multi-unit dwellings. It is usually found in areas that are already well-served by infrastructure such as public transport, shopping centers, schools, and other services.
* **Building Height and Density**: Buildings in the Urban Zone can be **taller** and more densely packed compared to the Mixed Suburban Zone. Depending on the specific location within the zone, you may see buildings that range from **4-8 stories** in height or even higher, particularly in areas with strong demand for housing.
* **Mixed-Use Development**: In certain parts of the Urban Zone, residential use may be combined with commercial or retail spaces, leading to the development of **mixed-use buildings** that create vibrant urban environments with a focus on live-work-play spaces.
* **Intensification and Urban Renewal**: Areas within the Urban Zone are prioritized for **urban renewal** and **intensification**, making them ideal locations for new developments, particularly in inner-city or well-connected suburban areas.
* **Small Lot Sizes**: The lot sizes in Urban Zones are generally smaller than those in suburban zones, particularly in areas where apartments and high-rise buildings are permitted. The focus here is more on maximizing space and accommodating a larger population in a compact area.

**Pros:**

* **Access to Amenities**: The Urban Zone tends to be located in areas with close access to essential services like shopping centers, schools, healthcare, and public transport. This makes it ideal for those who prioritize urban living.
* **Vibrant Community**: Higher density living means that there are typically more people, leading to a dynamic and active community with a variety of options for entertainment, work, and social interaction.
* **Public Transport Accessibility**: Areas in the Urban Zone tend to have better **public transport links**, making it ideal for those who rely on buses, trains, or ferries for commuting.

**Cons:**

* **Lack of Outdoor Space**: Properties in the Urban Zone may lack the outdoor space you’d find in suburban areas. If you enjoy gardens or yards, you may need to compromise when living in high-rise or dense developments. Some of these places can have just 20sqm of outdoor space!
* **Potential Noise and Crowding**: Higher-density living means more people in closer proximity, which can lead to **noise**, **crowding**, and potentially a less private living experience.
* **Price Fluctuations**: In some areas, rapid urbanization and intensification can lead to fluctuating property prices, which may result in higher entry costs for buyers and potential challenges in long-term affordability.

## Terraced Housing and Apartment Zone (THAB)

The **Terraced Housing and Apartment Zone (THAB)** is one of the most significant zoning categories within Auckland’s Unitary Plan, reflecting the city's move toward higher-density living. This zone is designed to support the growth of housing in areas where higher population density is both desired and feasible. It’s ideal for areas close to transport hubs, commercial centers, or where intensification is a key part of urban planning.

#### Key Characteristics:

* **Higher-Density Living**: The THAB zone allows for the construction of **terraced housing** and **apartments**, which means that properties in this zone can accommodate multiple dwellings on a single plot of land. This zoning facilitates higher-density developments like apartment buildings and rows of terraced houses.
* **Building Height and Density**: In the THAB zone, buildings can be as tall as **16-18 meters** (around **4-5 stories**), depending on the area. This is a significant increase from the typically smaller, single or two-story homes found in suburban zones. The height and number of dwellings can vary, but generally, these areas are built to accommodate more people in a smaller footprint.
* **Urban Intensification**: The THAB zone is typically found in urban areas close to existing infrastructure, such as public transport, schools, and commercial hubs. These zones are key to Auckland’s intensification strategy, which aims to increase the city’s housing stock without expanding its urban footprint. It’s commonly located near major roads, train stations, bus stops, or shopping centers.
* **Lot Size**: The **lot sizes** in THAB zones are typically smaller, especially in areas with high demand for housing. These properties are designed for **multi-unit housing**, meaning the individual homes may be on **smaller sections** but with shared walls, common areas, or even communal amenities.
* **Affordable Housing Potential**: Due to the nature of THAB zoning, it’s expected that this zone will provide opportunities for more **affordable housing** options, as the denser developments generally have a lower cost per dwelling due to shared infrastructure, land, and resources. This makes it an appealing option for those looking to live in the city center or close to amenities but with more budget-friendly options compared to standalone homes.

#### The Pros and Cons:

* **Pros**:
  * **Closer to Amenities**: Properties in the THAB zone are often near **transport hubs**, **commercial centers**, and other amenities, offering excellent access to public services, employment opportunities, schools, and entertainment.
  * **Potential for Growth**: The zone is designed to support **urban intensification**, making it a good option for investors or people seeking to live in a rapidly developing area.
  * **More Affordable Living**: The higher density typically reduces the cost per dwelling, making these areas more affordable for people who want to live in the city but can’t afford traditional suburban homes.
  * **Urban Lifestyle**: This zone supports a more **urban lifestyle**, offering the convenience of city living, with smaller homes and apartments, ideal for young professionals, couples, and those who prioritize location and amenities.
* **Cons**:
  * **Less Privacy**: With higher-density living, there is less privacy than you would find in suburban areas. Terraced houses or apartments often have **shared walls** and common spaces, which can be noisy and may reduce the sense of personal space.
  * **Crowded Areas**: Due to the high density of housing, these areas can feel crowded, especially as they become more developed. There may also be increased traffic congestion and higher competition for parking spaces.
  * **Limited Outdoor Space**: Many properties in the THAB zone, especially apartments and terraced houses, have **limited outdoor space**, which may not be ideal for families with children or anyone who values private gardens or larger backyards.
  * **Potential for Oversupply**: In some areas, high levels of development could lead to **oversupply** of housing in the short term, which may affect property values and lead to fluctuations in the market.

The **Terraced Housing and Apartment Zone (THAB)** is a key element of Auckland’s strategy for growth and densification. It provides opportunities for higher-density living in desirable urban locations, which is especially appealing to those who want to live near amenities and transport links but don’t need large properties. However, the trade-off is a loss of privacy and outdoor space, and potentially more crowded living conditions. It’s ideal for those seeking an urban lifestyle with easy access to the heart of Auckland, but it’s important to weigh the benefits of location and affordability against the downsides of dense living.
