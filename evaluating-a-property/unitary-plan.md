# Unitary Plan

The Auckland Unitary Plan (AUP) is a master planning document created by Auckland Council to unify city planning across the supercity, and supersede the individual planning done by the previous seven city councils. This plan has a major impact on the price of property and its future potential.

**Important:** If you can build in the zone, don't forget your neighbours can too. So if you buy in a THAB zone, don't expect to have the lovely 1960s house stay next to you, and be prepared for a 10 storey apartment if RCs are met.

## Single Housing Zone

Single housing zones are common within the central isthmus, these suburbs are designed to be low-density and typically contain expensive and older homes. When you buy a property in this zone, you will not have potential to subdivide it.

The great thing about these zones is the lack of density and lifestyle – your neighbours won’t be building 3 properties in their backyard, but the bad news is you can’t either.

## Mixed Suburban Zone

The mixed suburban zone is the most common zoning across Auckland – most of these lots can have 2 story freestanding homes and can be as small as 400m2. This is the typical residential zone. Depending on the area, many mixed suburban zones are being rapidly intensified to make use of the classic 800m2 sections, so a lot of them will have shared driveways and houses reasonably close together.

## Mixed Urban Zone

Mixed urban zones let you intensify the land area – as low as 300m2 per property. These zones are typically found on main roads, and near town centres or THAB zones. When buying in this zone, remember that Auckland is a growing city, and the vast backyard of your neighbour can easily be turned into a construction site quickly. Of course, if your land is large enough, you will benefit from the same privilege.

## Terraced Housing and Apartment Zone (THAB)

THAB zones are designed to bring European style terraced and apartment housing to central areas. If you’re buying a larger sized area of land in this area, it’s likely to be competitive, but there is a lot of subdivision potential attached, and future owners have significant upside attached to the land.
