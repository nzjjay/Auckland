# Insurance

## Insurance is mandatory!

Insurance is a condition of finance from all banks. You **must** be sure you can insure any property before you go unconditional on it. Not doing so can cause serious distress if the bank refuses lending as a result of a lack of insurance.&#x20;

If you are making any sort of offer or going to auction, ensure you are 100% confident by getting quotes prior.

## Insurance Brokers

All properties will require insurance from the bank. Older properties (pre-1955) or houses with special materials will have more complicated insurance requirements. If you’re searching for straightforward properties, you can skip this and just get quotes online. But if you are looking at properties with special characteristics (such as age, heritage, or materials), then you’ll need an insurance broker. Most mortgage brokers also offer this.

## Insurance certificate and Bank

The bank will be a registered interest if you are securing a mortgage over a property. Therefore it is very important that during the insurance process, you convey the interests your bank has in your property.

## Re-build value

After the Christchurch earthquakes, insurers now insure you for a sum-assured value that you determine, generally based off the Cordell-Sum system. It's really important you consider how much insurance coverage you require for your personal circumstances - don't forget about the cost of rebuilding a property after a natural disaster when everyone else is trying to do the same.
