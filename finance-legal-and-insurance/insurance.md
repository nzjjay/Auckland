# Insurance

## Insurance is mandatory!

Insurance is a condition of finance from all banks. You **must** be sure you can insure any property before you go unconditional on it. Not doing so can cause serious distress if the bank refuses lending as a result of a lack of insurance.&#x20;

If you are making any sort of offer or going to auction, ensure you are 100% confident by getting quotes prior.

## Insurance Brokers

All properties will require insurance from the bank. Older properties (pre-1955) or houses with special materials will have more complicated insurance requirements. If you’re searching for straightforward properties, you can skip this and just get quotes online. But if you are looking at properties with special characteristics (such as age, heritage, or materials), then you’ll need an insurance broker. Most mortgage brokers also offer this.

## Insurance certificate and bank

The bank will be a registered interest if you are securing a mortgage over a property. Therefore, it is very important that during the insurance process, you convey the interests your bank has in your property.

## Re-build value

After the Christchurch earthquakes, insurers now insure you for a sum-assured value that you determine, generally based off the Cordell-Sum system. It's really important you consider how much insurance coverage you require for your personal circumstances - don't forget about the cost of rebuilding a property after a natural disaster when everyone else is trying to do the same.&#x20;

## Insurance exclusions

Be really careful about any exclusions in your insurance policy. For example, some insurers exclude coastal erosion - if you can see the ocean from your house, congratulations and commiserations, because there's a chance the ocean swallows your house up, or your house slides down into it - and insurance won't care. Read your coverage carefully.

## Self-Insurance

This is solely my opinion, but if you reach a point where you are mortgage free and have sufficient net worth, you are not legally or mandatorily required to have insurance on your house - you effectively "self-insure". This saves the premium costs, and you bear the risk. This could work well in some circumstances - e.g. a shack on a plot of land.&#x20;
