### Lawyers

A good property lawyer is worth their billables. Some lawyers will charge per title / property you send their way to review, while others will come to a goodwill agreement that you will definitely go with them when you buy, and they’ll bill you a slightly above average price when that occurs. Budget around $2000 for this. You’ll look at a few properties so make sure to do some pre-vetting before sending to your lawyers.
