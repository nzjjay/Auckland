### Lawyers

Buying a house in Auckland without a skilled lawyer is a risky proposition. A good lawyer will protect you, manage all the complex paperwork, and give you peace of mind. Think of their fees as an investment in avoiding mistakes that could cost you tens of thousands later.

Lawyers handle a range of tasks for home buyers, including:

* Advising you on any potential issues with the property and things to consider before making an offer.
* Preparing Kiwisaver withdrawals if you meet the criteria and choose to use this scheme.
* Drafting and reviewing the Sale and Purchase agreement and handling any amendments post-offer.
* Coordinating in-office signings for:
  * Mortgage documents
  * Title transfer documents
  * Anti-money laundering (AML) verification
  * Proof of funds for AML compliance
* Facilitating the transfer of funds to the seller on settlement day, including managing the bank’s lending portion.

Essentially, your lawyer is the person who ensures that all the legal and financial machinery runs smoothly from offer to settlement. Choosing the right lawyer is crucial: trust and competence are key. Pick someone you feel confident in and let them manage the process.

**Lawyer Costs**

Lawyer fees can vary widely. Some lawyers charge per property review, while others will offer a goodwill arrangement where you commit to using them for your purchase in exchange for a slightly higher—but bundled—fee. Budget around $2,000 for this service, depending on complexity.

Pre-vetting properties before sending them to your lawyer can save both time and money. Some lawyers charge for each due diligence review, so limiting the number of properties you submit for review is practical.

For example, our family lawyer charges $1,650 + GST. They do not charge extra for property due diligence before settlement and have even helped resolve settlement issues without additional fees—though most lawyers will charge for this. Always discuss fees upfront and understand the scope of what is included. You don’t want lawyer fees to exceed the cost of resolving any issue yourself.
