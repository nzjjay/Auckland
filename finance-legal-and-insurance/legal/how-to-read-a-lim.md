### How to read a LIM

The LIM report will tell you the property’s story from the Council perspective. It can be a valuable addition in supplement to the research on the GIS Viewer. There are a few things to look for:

1\.       Code of Compliance: Make sure the house, all alterations, and basically everything has CCC issued.

2\.       Issue date: The LIM should have been issued recently, ones before the house listed aren’t appropriate.

3\.       Any issues: The LIM will indicate if any claims have been made in relation to weathertightness, soil erosion, drainage, etc.

Your lawyer is best positioned for the details. But if you can do a quick read to identify the CCC is missing, etc, it will save you and your lawyer time, and build a better working relationship with them.
