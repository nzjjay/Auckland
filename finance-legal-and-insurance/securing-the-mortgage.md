# Securing the mortgage

Once you’ve gone unconditional at auction or conditional on offer, it’s time to arrange the mortgage for settlement. Whether you are using a broker or going to the bank directly, here’s some things to note.

### Prepare your financials

You would have done all this previously, but revisit your financials and get your income, expenses, and current assets lined up. This will make it easy for the bank to give you lending approval fast.

### The Banks

There are three classes of banks in New Zealand:

Ø  Australian Banks: ANZ, Westpac, BNZ, and ASB. They make up the majority of lending and are all pretty much the same when it comes to their rates and treatment.

Ø  New Zealand Banks: Kiwibank and TSB. These banks are usually a bit more competitive than the Australian banks but may have some drawbacks like their lending criteria and branch availability.

Ø  Chinese Banks: ICBC, Bank of China, HSBC. These banks generally offer the best interest rates, but tend to have other costs like requiring valuations, and application fees. They also generally don’t do cashbacks for your first mortgage.

### Interest Rate

The interest rate is what you’ll pay on the outstanding mortgage principal. This can be fixed for a certain time period, or floating. When you talk to your banker, they will arrange a loan structure for you that lets you decide the formula you want – e.g. you may want to fix $700,000, and float $400,000.

### Term

The number of expected years of principal repayments is your mortgage term. Longer terms (like 30 years) mean you pay less in principal payments yearly but pay more interest over the term of your mortgage. A shorter term means you’ll pay more in principal payments, but less in interest over the term of your mortgage.

### Cashback

Almost all Australian banks offer a “reward” or “cashback” where they will give you hard cash for signing up with them. This will range from $5000 - $8000. When interest rates are low, this incentive can contribute a lot to the first year’s interest payments. Make sure you understand what this is, what comes with this – most banks will expect you to stay loyal to them for 3+ years in exchange.

### Negotiating

We live in a capitalist society – be transparent and promiscuous with every bank’s terms – shake em’ all down and find yourself the best rate. Don’t hesitate to go back and forth with each bank. Almost all banks will offer a better rate than what they “card” on their front doors. Having a larger deposit will also make you more competitive.

### Carded Interest Rates

The rate you see advertised at a bank is what’s called the “carded” interest rate. In reality, the actual interest rate can be significantly lower. ANZ in generally offer their customers 6 basis points lower than the carded rate, and up to 75 basis points on floating rates. The banks create this opaque rate system to prevent other banks from competing with them. Basically, don’t say yes to the rate that’s plastered all over their walls.
