# Creating a shortlist

Searching, shortlisting, and viewing properties is the most time-consuming aspect of the property purchasing process, and you will visit a lot of properties if you do this right!

Start by browsing websites such as Trademe Property and agency sites to get a view for the kind of properties on the market. It can take you anywhere between your first home open, to years, to find the right house.&#x20;

## Shortlisting Properties

You will have your own set of characteristics you want in your property. You should write these down, preferably in a re-usable to-do list, so you can quickly assess whether a property meets your needs. Over time, you will be tempted (out of desperation) by properties that don't meet these standards, and that's when you'll need the willpower to say no and wait.

As you search online, it’s worth it to create a shortlist of what characteristics are acceptable. We’ll discuss these in more detail soon, but for now, this is the type of quick-fire shortlist checklist you’ll want when searching online or in-person.

| Characteristic     | Requirement                   | Why                                                |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Title              | Freehold                      | Want a clean title                                 |
| Building material  | Weatherboard, Brick & Tile    | Want a no-fuss watertight home                     |
| Land Area          | 400m2+                        | Want a bit of space                                |
| Bedrooms           | 4-5                           | For the future family :)                           |
| Close to Transport | 500m walk to bus stop / train | So I dont have to be on state carpark 16 every day |
| Natural Light      | Plenty                        | Because I am not a vampire                         |
| Garage             | Atleast 2 big spots           | We have 2 SUVs                                     |
| Bathroom           | 2                             | We all leave for work at the same time             |

This is a blunt instrument, and you should use it with some generosity, but it can be a great way of dismissing properties before visiting and discovering it didn’t suit your needs anyway. If there’s a property that’s on the edge – go, see it in person.

## Quick checks

You don’t need to be a lawyer to work out a lemon, all agents can send you the title and LIM report by email before you visit the property. You can also easily do some research on the building virtually. Read these documents (appendix contains information on how to), and make sure you’re happy with it. There’s no point driving across town to see a house that’s a leasehold you’d never consider, or a house that’s made from stucco that the agent’s hidden in the photos.
