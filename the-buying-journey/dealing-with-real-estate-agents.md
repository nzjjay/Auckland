# Dealing with real estate agents

Most real-estate agents I have dealt with have been great professionals, that care about what they do, and have provided me a great buying experience. Remember through - the real estate agent works for the seller.

Unfortunately, there can be some agents that can cause issues for you. As a first home buyer, you will be naïve to them, so this section is here to prepare you with their tactics.

## Buying agents

Most real estate agencies have buying agents who help serious buyers find suitable properties. They work on commission, so they usually only assist committed clients and are free for buyers. While you don’t need a buying agent—and many don’t work well with first-home buyers—you might find one willing to help. If you do, always contact them first before viewing a property, as they only earn a commission if they’re with you on your first visit.

## Selling agents

Selling agents, or listing agents, are agents who list properties on the market. These agents work for the seller and are only incentivized by the seller.&#x20;

## Good things to know

### Disclosures

Agents by law cannot lie to you. They must truthfully disclose what the vendor has told them or what they have discovered. The problem is, the dodgy agents will ask sellers to not tell them anything bad, which means it is very hard for you to prove they knew something and didn't tell you down the track. Do not take an agents word at face value - verify.

### "Market Feedback"

I often send agents texts asking for the "market feedback" for a property. The good agents will text back with a figure or range. This immediately tells you what the vendor expects or has been guided on, or what other visitors to the open home have expressed. There's lots of disclaimers with this market feedback, but it tells you if you're in the range of not. There's no point visiting a property with feedback of 1.8M when your budget is 1M. However agents will also play up or play down the feedback. Here's how it works:

If an agent wants more people at the auction, they will state a lower market feedback, to get people to the room and create a crowd.

If an agent wants to price anchor, they will state a higher market feedback, hoping to nab someone that is less familiar with the value of the property.

Be mindful of this.

### Private viewing

Agents can arrange private viewings for you, so don't hesitate to ask them to see it outside of an open home. Most will happily oblige for serious buyers.

## Bad tactics

### Brushing you off

Agents intentionally brush you off or give you that “look” when you visit their open homes. It’s not that they think you can’t afford it, it’s because they want to make you desperate and feel like you _need_ to prove something by signing an offer or raising at auction. Don’t fall for their ego tricks.

### Pressuring you to make an offer

Agents will try to get you to say a price, and make an offer on it. The offer is so the agent can take it back to the owner as proof that they’re working hard for them, and also as ammunition to prepare them if their expected price is too high. Don’t make offers on property unless you actually like it, and be prepared for agents to talk price with you, then come back and tell you no - they’re trying to play you.

### The pre-auction offer

Agents love a pre-auction offer (you’ll see what I mean after a few open homes). This is when you make an offer that’s acceptable to the vendor that brings the auction forward. Agents will claim it lets you cut out the competition and lets you win faster. Try avoiding this because the only person that really benefits is the agent – they can sell the house in a shorter timespan and have to do less work. Also, if the price is acceptable to the vendor, it will also be acceptable two weeks later at the actual auction day too.

### The multi-offer offer

You try to make an offer on the house, and the agent tells you others have made offers too that are more competitive. Don’t fall for this, they’re trying to shake you down for more. Just present the offer you deem appropriate. One of two things will happen – the vendor will accept the higher offer, which is fair game, or the agent will call you in 2 business days asking for the original offer, making an excuse about the other buyer pulling out.

### Undervaluing the house

This one gets on my nerves – you go to the open home and the agent will tell you the market feedback is one million. You go to auction, and the bidding hits 1.1m, and the reserve still isn’t met. Turns out the vendors actually want 1.2m. What’s happened here my friends, is you’ve just become an unwitting crowd for an auction to pressure some poor serious buyer into bidding because there’s “demand” for the property. The agent knows what the vendor wants, they know what the property will likely sell for, they have intentionally told you a lower amount so you think you have a chance and show up at the auction. Again, do your own valuations and math. If it’s too good to be true, it probably is. There are no bargains in Auckland.
