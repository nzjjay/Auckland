# Donate / Koha to your community



This guide is my **gift** to you. However, if you really enjoyed it, gained value from it, and want to give back, please do so by sharing this with others who'll find it helpful, and giving back to your community...

If you have a mortgage or about to get one, consider **not donating money**, and instead **donate your time** - every dollar counts for you as well, and your time is invaluable for the City Mission.

## Support Auckland's City Mission reducing homelessness

All donations / koha (less Stripe fees) will be passed on to the **Auckland City Mission.** These folks do incredible work for the community and has a special place in my heart. For everyone reading this guide, remember we are incredibly privileged to even contemplate buying a house, when many of our fellow Aucklanders face a night of nowhere to live.

**Donate via me / Stripe:** This helps me keep track of how helpful you found the guide, and I can make one consolidated payment occasionally to the City Mission.&#x20;
