# Getting a pre-approval



You've decided to buy a house, great! If you are filthy rich and have a cool million dollars sitting in your bank, you can skip this section altogether, but if you're like the rest of us, before you get carried away looking at houses, the first thing you'll need to do is go talk to your bank or a broker and get a **home loan pre-approval**, which is a formal process with your bank that gives you a pre-approved lending amount with a lot of conditions attached that ultimately tells you how much you can borrow from the bank for your home, and therefore, your budget.

### Banker or Broker?

The age old question, and truth be told, there's no right answer.  Speak to a bank or broker. At this stage in the process, my suggestion is to reach out to your current bank (if you "like" them). The reason is - at this stage in your buying process, banks are non-exclusive, and you can pick and choose any or multiple to go with later. Many brokers will ask you to sign a exclusivity deal with them, meaning you have to go with them for financing in exchange for their advice and service or have a clawback. It's totally up to you, but do your homework on what you need at this early stage in the process.

All major banks have what they call in some form, a "Home Loan Coach" or "Mobile Mortgage Manager". These helpful folks are employees of the bank, know their specific banks inside out, and can give you very bespoke and tailored advice. In fact, my banker, Alex, went above and beyond to help me secure my first dream home, and without his tenacity and speed being a bank employee, I would have lost the house at auction. &#x20;

Brokers on the other hand, are independent of banks, and work for themselves in a loose sense, they get a commission from the bank to sell you the home loan product (it can be about 0.85% of the total lending). Brokers can be handy because different banks have different policies and rules, and brokers can sometimes be an emotional "wall" between you and the bank. Sometimes its easier to let the broker explain to the bank you'll cut down your food delivery expenditure once you have the home loan.

### What do I need for a pre-approval?

Regardless of if you go to the bank directly, or a broker, they'll need the same set of documents, as part of the credit checks, to assess how much you can borrow. Things they'll want to know:

1. Your income (Have atleast 3-6 months of payslips and your employment agreement)
2. Your household situation post loan (e.g. will you be flatting, kids, etc)
3. Your current expenses that indicate what your outgoings will be like (a complex area, but basically, be truthful to the bank)
4. How much you're asking to borrow from them and if you have any security (e.g. deposits, other homes, etc)

Using these, the bank will give you a generic pre-approval for a set amount. This is their total **lending** they'll offer you, it is conditional on many things they'll set out in the letter, but basically, the amount they'll lend plus your deposit is your maximum budget for a property you want to buy.

Once you find a house you like, the bank will take it into consideration and give you a _final_ maximum lending amount for that specific property. There's many reasons for this, including ensuring you don't overspend (e.g. using 1 mil of lending to pay 1.2 mil for a home only worth 800k), and verifying the home itself isn't going to be a money sink (e.g. leaky).

You only need **one** pre-approval to get started, you don't need to take out lending with the bank that initially gave you pre-approval, and remember, the pre-approval can change or be withdrawn at any time, especially if your circumstances change!

On pre-approval, you will get a formal letter advising you of what amount you can borrow and what conditions are attached to the lending. Remember, this is just general lending. You still need to talk to the bank about each and every property you want to borrow that money on.

## Running the numbers

The banks are bound by regulation to ensure they lend responsibly to you and all other customers. The banks will factor in a lot of things, but these three are must-haves.

### The LVR (Loan Value Ratio)

You’ll hear about “LVR” a lot, this standards for Loan Value Ratio. A LVR is the ratio of a loan amount to the value of the property being purchased. Lenders use LVRs to assess the risk of lending money for a property. To calculate LVR, pick a property and divide the loan amount by the property's value. This gives you the LVR percentage. Typically, banks are content when you have a 20% deposit and open doors for you. Anything less than 20% makes you a riskier proposition. Where possible aim for a 20% deposit to give you the best bargaining ability and for your own sanity. There are some exemptions to LVR rules, but remember, the rules are there to protect you.&#x20;

### DTI (Debt to Income Ratio)

A debt-to-income (DTI) ratio compares your total debt to your gross income. It's a key factor that lenders use to determine your financial stability and your ability to repay a loan. To calculate the DTI, add up all your debts, including the proposed debt / amount you want to borrow, and divide it by your total income. If you have a partner, use the cumulative numbers. Banks will generally look at 6-7x DTI, you don't want to be borrowing much more on top of your income.

### Free Cash Flow

The proper accountants will be mad at me for using this terminology, but it sticks in a personal accounting sense. The banks will look closely at your after tax income coming in, and monthly subscriptions, and expenses that cannot be avoided going out with a buffer for little one of expenses. This essentially calculates your savings, which you will be using to contribute to your home loan. If you are making $4000 after tax per month, but spending $3800, the bank will find it hard to justify lending you money where the monthly repayments are greater than $200.&#x20;
