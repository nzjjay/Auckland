# Government websites you should use

The government / local council has really useful websites that are invaluable for your property search. In fact these are what I immediately look at whenever I see a property I have any interest in. Save these for future reference.

## Auckland Flood Viewer

[Experience (arcgis.com)](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/cbde7f2134404f4d90adce5396a0a630)

Due to the 2022 Auckland Floods, the council has created a separate map view of flood risk properties. My advice is if the property is on or very close to a flood plain, etc â€“ you need to be careful.

## Auckland Council GIS Viewer

The Auckland Council GIS viewer is a geomapping tool that lets you see all sorts of information about the Auckland region and properties specifically. Once you understand the tool, you can see:

1\.       Topography

2\.       Zoning (e.g. special character areas)

3\.       Nearby stormwater and wastewater

4. Other things, like power lines... (pictured)

## Auckland Council Unitary Plan Viewer

The Auckland council unitary plan viewer lets you see the unitary plan zone for the property. This will have a major influence on the market price, regardless of what the CV may say. It also indicates the future subdivision potential of the property.

## Housing NZ / Kianga Ora / Govt property map

[https://linz.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=8501fe601f7648718d0e3a2f3f1ed216](https://linz.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=8501fe601f7648718d0e3a2f3f1ed216)

This LINZ map shows all government / crown owned properties in New Zealand. More interestingly, it shows the locations of all Housing New Zealand properties as well. This can be helpful if proximity to state owned housing is important or a cause of concern for you.&#x20;

It also gives you a good understanding of government land, in case you are buying next to a crown asset that may need expansion in the future (you don't want a Public Works Act 1981 letter trust me).
