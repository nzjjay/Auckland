# Tender, Negotiation, and Deadline

When it comes to making an offer on a property, tenders, negotiations, and deadline sales are very similar, but there are key differences that are important to understand.

One thing to remember: real estate agents are bound by code to present **all offers** to the vendor. While they may provide guidance, you can submit the offer you feel is right.

## Tender

The **tender process** is essentially a blind bidding system:

* You submit your offer without knowing what others are offering.
* All offers are presented together to the vendor and agent.
* The vendor can **accept, negotiate, or decline** any of the tenders.
* Tender offers are **opened after the tender deadline**, and the vendor may change the deadline if needed.
* You are **legally bound** to your tender offer.
* A **deposit is required** with your offer and is retained if your tender is accepted.

## Negotiation

Negotiation works like any other real-world negotiation, with the agent acting as an intermediary:

* You can negotiate **price, deposit, settlement date, or conditions** such as:
  * Subject to finance approval
  * Subject to legal approval
  * Subject to insurance approval
  * Subject to a satisfactory building inspection
* Unlike tenders, you can **withdraw your offer at any time**, and no deposit is required.
* Multi-offer scenarios are common here — if multiple buyers are interested, present your strongest offer.

## Deadline Sale

To be honest this just means the house wants to be sold by x date. It's pretty much the same as negotiation though. Think of it this way - if the house isn't sold or offers made, it's not like they're going to suddenly not sell the house. Don't stress too much about time.

## Multi-offer

A multi offer situation can only occur if the agency has more than one written offer for a property. This is typically seen post-auction pass-ins, and in price by negotiation situations. This works very similarly to price by negotiation.
