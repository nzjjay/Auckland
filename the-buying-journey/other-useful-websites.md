## Trademe Property

{% embed url="https://www.trademe.co.nz/a/property/residential/sale" %}

Trademe Property is my go-to tool to find properties, especially because of their easy to use UI. However not all vendors list on this site given the high fees.&#x20;

## Oneroof

Oneroof will tell you the CV, and past sales history for the property in one place. Ignore the estimates it provides as it’s usually wildly inaccurate, but use it for the zoning and other information it provides under one roof.

## Homes.co.nz

[https://homes.co.nz](https://homes.co.nz)

Homes.co.nz offers the same information as most of the other sites, but can be a better UI. Be careful about the valuations as agents can update these. The flip side is you can kind of get a feel for what they’ve promised the vendor.
