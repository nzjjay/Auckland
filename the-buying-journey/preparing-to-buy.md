# Preparing to buy

Found a house you like, and are ready to go to auction for it or make a conditional offer? Here's what you need to know.

## Deposit

Make sure you have money to settle the initial deposit! Most people know about 20% LVR and needing a 20% deposit to buy a house, but you will typically need to pay a 10% cash deposit upfront on the fall of the hammer or once the sale goes conditional. You need to have these funds sitting in a on-call account ready to be transferred.

It is unacceptable and almost unheard of to not be able to pay the deposit, so make sure you have this sorted or you'll be in a lot of pain.

## Bank Approvals

Go back to the bank where you have the pre-approval, and submit the property title, Sale and Purchase Agreement, LIM and other information to them for a further approval to purchase the property. Although you can make this a condition of sale on non-auction sale types, this is a straightforward step so you may as well do it before you make any offers and save everyone time.

## Insurance Approvals

Insurance is straightforward for most properties, but if you are trying to insure one of these:

1\.       Older than 1955

2\.       Has structural issues or other significant problems

3\.       Near or on a natural hazard

4\.       Has complications like granny flats

Call your insurance company or broker and get a proper full coverage insurance quote before you proceed any further. This is important because there have been cases where once you win the property or have the offer succeed, the insurance companies may decline coverage due to various reasons. If Insurance does not offer cover, your bank cannot lend you money, meaning you are in deep hot water quite quickly, and are still obliged to settle.

## Lawyer Approvals

Your lawyer needs to give you guidance on if you should proceed or not. They will conduct initial due diligence. Email the title, LIM, sale and purchase agreement, and anything else to your lawyer for review and approval. This is not a DIY step.

## Building Reports

Be pragmatic about building reports. As a first home buyer going to mostly unconditional auctions, you have limited funds, and are justifiably uninformed about buildings. At $700+ per report, you can become very poor very fast if you get a report on every house you’re attempting to buy (and subsequently lose during the offer or auction). Use common sense when it comes to these reports and use them sparingly. If you’re buying a brand-new townhouse / new build with a 10 year master builder warranty from a reputable builder, you may have a different need to if you’re looking at a 1910s villa that looks like a bad do-up, you definitely want a builder to come in and take a look.

For all conditional offers, make sure building reports are a condition of sale - your lawyer will help with this.

Once you arranger a builder, they will liaise with the listing agent to arrange for an inspection.

Try find a builder who you can walk with on their inspection – they will give you a high-level overview of what to look out for, so you can do the basics yourself, and call them in for more expert eyes.

The main thing with building reports is your comfort level – are you comfortable enough with the building and accepting of any repair work that is presented? No building will be perfect, and it’s the builder’s job to point out every minor imperfection.&#x20;
