# Searching and shortlisting  homes

## Searching and shortlisting properties

Once you’ve got your pre-approval and a clear idea of your budget, the next step is **searching for properties** and building your shortlist. To do this effectively, you first need to form a sense of what you truly want in a home.

***

### Explore the neighbourhoods

Start by **getting out and about**. Drive or walk around the suburbs you’re interested in. Notice what appeals to you: the style of the houses, the street vibe, nearby amenities, parks, shops, and public transport. Equally, pay attention to what doesn’t work for you — traffic, noise, or areas that feel unsafe or inconvenient.

Visiting a few **open homes** with an open mind is invaluable. It helps you develop a sense of what you must-have, should-have, and could-have in a property. At this stage, a rough idea is perfectly fine — you’ll refine it as you gain experience in the market.

You can also use online resources like **Trade Me Property**, **homes.co.nz**, and local real estate websites to see what’s on the market and what similar properties are selling for. This gives you an early feel for pricing and availability in Auckland’s competitive market, helping you refine your expectations before making serious decisions.

### Create your list: must-haves vs nice-to-haves

Once you’ve explored neighbourhoods and properties, write down your **must-haves** and **could-haves** in bullet points. This becomes your guiding document during the search.

* **Must-haves:** Features you cannot compromise on.
* **Could-haves:** Features that would be nice, but aren’t deal-breakers.

It’s natural for your list to change as you continue your search. Sometimes, market realities force adjustments, and other times, standing firm is the right call — remember, this is likely the biggest purchase you’ll make, and you’ll spend years living in this home. Compromising on what matters most can lead to frustration later.

#### Document the reasoning

For every item on your list, write down **why** it matters. This reflection helps you prioritize effectively and prevents you from dropping key features simply because a property is tempting. It also provides clarity if you ever need to reassess your priorities.

Here’s an example from my own first-home shortlist:

**Jay's first home property shortlist**

* **Less than 5 minutes’ walk to rapid public transit**\
  &#xNAN;_&#x42;ecause I spent 1.5 hours commuting each way in the city and never want to experience that again. Also, so I can drink with friends on Friday night without paying for overpriced Ubers._
* **A big garage or basement**\
  &#xNAN;_&#x42;ecause I enjoy DIY and want secure storage for my car and tools._
* **Elevated section**\
  &#xNAN;_&#x46;or plenty of natural light and reduced flood risk._
* **Land size: 400–600sqm**\
  &#xNAN;_&#x50;rovides a buffer with neighbours without creating too much lawn to maintain._
* **3–4 bedrooms**\
  &#xNAN;_&#x53;o we can plan for a future family._

### Start searching

With your list in hand, it’s time to start searching for homes! There are **two parts**: searching, then shortlisting.

* **Searching** is simple. Open a property search app (Trade Me, Homes, Realestate.co.nz), enter your criteria, and start adding properties to your watchlist. Collaboration tools help if you’re buying with a partner — for example, my wife and I share the same account, take notes, and discuss each property together.
* While searching sounds straightforward, focus on **verifiable criteria first**: location, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and other essentials. If a property ticks these boxes, add it to your shortlist. Don’t dismiss homes that deviate slightly from your ideal — for example, a listing with 3 bedrooms and a study might still suit your needs if you wanted 4 bedrooms.

***

### Buyers’ agents

Some agents work for buyers instead of sellers, usually at higher-end properties or when starting out. Buyers’ agents are paid by commission from the listing agency (so typically, you don’t pay), but always confirm terms first.

They can be invaluable because:

* They monitor the market for you, alerting you to new listings early.
* They can advise on pre-auction offers and help you move quickly on competitive deals.

If a buyers’ agent works hard on your behalf, it’s courteous to give them some exclusivity — e.g., work with them to visit or close deals, rather than bypassing them to approach the listing agent directly.

### Shortlisting properties

Once a property is on your shortlist, you can check several things **before visiting**:

* Do you and your partner like the look of it?
* Is it in a desired location? (Use Google Maps)
* Is it in the correct school zone? (Ministry of Education zoning maps)
* Is it in a flood-prone area? (Auckland Council flood viewer)
* What is the cladding type? (Photos can help)

Other important aspects are best assessed **in person**, so once it passes these initial checks, schedule a viewing.

***

### Start refining your shortlist

As you browse properties online and attend open homes, check each against your list:

* **✔** if a property meets a must-have
* **✖** if it doesn’t
* **1–5** for could-haves, depending on how well it matches

Over time, you’ll notice patterns and start to **refine your preferences**, creating a sharper, more focused search that saves time and reduces stress.

Shortlisting effectively is about **clarity, consistency, and reflection** — knowing what you want, why you want it, and what you can compromise on. With this framework, you’ll be ready to make confident, informed decisions when the right property comes along.
