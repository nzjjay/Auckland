# The visual journey map

There's a series of events that will take place when you are buying a home. First you'll see a bunch of properties, realise what you like and hate, then you'll finally find the one you like, and a whole bunch of things get set in motion.

The main one to think about right now is the type of offer being made. There are type types - conditional offers and unconditional. There's more on this in methods of buying, but this will impact how you approach the purchase process for each house.
