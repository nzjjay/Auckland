# Your buying journey

## Step by Step

Buying your first home is best treated as a sequence of clear, manageable steps. This book follows that process exactly — a practical roadmap that takes you from “Should I buy?” through to settlement, moving in, and first-year maintenance.

Below is the full roadmap. Each chapter will expand on these points with Auckland-specific guidance, checklists, worked examples and the questions you should be asking at every stage.

1. **Is buying a house right for you?**\
   A quick reality check — finances, lifestyle, time-horizon and how ready you are to take on the responsibilities of home ownership. We’ll cover the pros and cons, alternatives (stay renting, rent-vesting), and how to decide what’s best for _you_.
2. **Why buy instead of rent — and what about investment property?**\
   Understand the financial and lifestyle trade-offs between buying and renting in Auckland’s market. We also explain rent-vesting, owning a rental property, and why these are different decisions from buying your own home.
3. **Get bank pre-approval (mortgage pre-approval)**\
   What pre-approval is, why it matters, how to prepare the documents, and how to present yourself to lenders so you get a realistic borrowing limit — without accidentally locking yourself into an unsuitable loan.
4. **Decide what you want (and what you can compromise on)**\
   Practical exercises to create your must-have and nice-to-have lists. How to prioritise location, size, outdoor space, commute, schools, future resale, and flood/heritage/future-zoning risks common in Auckland.
5. **Searching, shortlisting and viewing properties**\
   How to run efficient searches, set alerts, and build a shortlist. What to look for during inspections and open homes (structural clues, water, damp, wiring, heating, insulation, boundaries). A printable viewing checklist will be provided.
6. **How to make an offer — private sale or auction strategy**\
   Step-by-step for negotiating a private sale and a separate playbook for winning at auction. Includes sample offer letters, how much deposit is typical, what conditions to include (building inspection, LIM, finance), and when to go unconditional.
7. **Conveyancing and the settlement process**\
   What a lawyer or conveyancer does, how title transfers work in NZ, reading a sale and purchase agreement, LIM and building reports, and how to navigate common legal pitfalls and timelines in Auckland.
8. **The bank financials — final mortgage steps**\
   Final lending conditions, preparing for valuation/surveyor visits, mortgage documents, interest rates, loan structure, and the costs you’ll need to budget before settlement (eg, lender fees, valuation fees, insurance).
9. **Settlement day and immediate practicalities**\
   What happens on settlement day, how keys are transferred, final meter reads, notifying utilities, arranging contents and building insurance, and a day-by-day 7-day post-settlement checklist.
10. **Moving in, running the household and first-year maintenance**\
    Setting up utilities, simple maintenance routines, a season-by-season maintenance plan, budgeting for repairs, and a checklist for the first 12 months (warranties, registered trades, council matters).
