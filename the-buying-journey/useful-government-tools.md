# Useful government tools

There's a lot of open source information from the government that can guide your property search. These tools are integral to my search and are my first port of call.

## Auckland Flood Viewer

[Experience (arcgis.com)](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/cbde7f2134404f4d90adce5396a0a630)

Due to the 2022 Auckland Floods, the council has created a separate map view of flood risk properties. My advice is if the property is on or very close to a flood plain, etc â€“ you need to be careful.

## Auckland Council GIS Viewer

The Auckland Council GIS viewer is a geomapping tool that lets you see all sorts of information about the Auckland region and properties specifically. Once you understand the tool, you can see:

1\.       Topography

2\.       Zoning (e.g. special character areas)

3\.       Nearby stormwater and wastewater

## Auckland Council Unitary Plan Viewer

[https://unitaryplanmaps.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/upviewer/](https://unitaryplanmaps.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/upviewer/)

The Auckland council unitary plan viewer lets you see the unitary plan zone for the property. This will have a major influence on the market price, regardless of what the CV may say. It also indicates the future subdivision potential of the property.

## Housing NZ / Kianga Ora property map

[https://linz.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=8501fe601f7648718d0e3a2f3f1ed216](https://linz.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=8501fe601f7648718d0e3a2f3f1ed216)

This LINZ map shows all government / crown owned properties in New Zealand. More interestingly, it shows the locations of all Housing New Zealand properties as well. This can be helpful if proximity to social housing is important or a cause of concern for you.
