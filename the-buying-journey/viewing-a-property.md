# Viewing a property

### The drive-by

A hot hack I have between shortlisting and viewing properties, is the drive-by. I stack the 5-10 houses I have on the shortlist, and simply drive to each of them in one go to see if I like the look of the house, street and area. You'll be surprised at how many houses can get knocked off your list just by doing this. Common reasons for me include being next to power pylons, a townhouse development happening next door, and just the "vibe" of the street - trust your gut.

## The viewing

Whether or not you do a drive-by, homes will have open homes between 11am - 3pm on weekends, or can be viewed by appointment. Stating the obvious, but DO NOT ever consider buying a house without seeing it in person. Do not hesitate to message agents asking for private viewings, or to spend a considerable amount of time at a property. You will learn that after a while you can cover houses in about 15 minutes.

Personally, I prefer open homes because it lets you see what other people are noticing – I once saw a few people staring intently at the bathroom ceiling, drawing my attention to the lack of an extractor fan and subsequent mould formation!

### Open homes

Open homes are just that. Show up at the allocated time, sign your name in (this is required to help agents with security - things can get stolen), and roam around.&#x20;

### Private viewing / by appointment

Feel welcome to request a private viewing from the listing agent. Most will be happy to oblige and will give you a private tour of the property, or open the doors and tell you to have at it.&#x20;

### Your lifestyle

It’s really important to know and picture how you would live your daily, mundane (let’s be honest) life at the property. We aren’t going to be entertaining our friends every day, we will be going to work, tending to children, cleaning, etc. Therefore, focus on the everyday rather than the “special appeals”. Remember the trade-offs too – a large piece of land is great for kids to play, but not so great when you have to mow it every two weeks in summer – what do you prefer?

I say every day because the _transport_ aspect matters a lot. How close is the bus-stop if you work in the city, and how long does the bus take? If you drive, can you easily get to your car in the pouring rain of an Auckland winter, and easily exit on to the road? Can you wash your car without annoying the neighbors in a shared driveway setting?

**Story:** I purchased a 1080sqm land, 280sqm house property in Mount Roskill, it was great for the first year before it dawned on me how much time I spent just cleaning, mowing, weeding, pruning and painting. I am still very happy with what I got, but I am more mindful about wishful lifestyles vs the reality of a corporate job, family life, and needing to spend the weekends cleaning and gardening....

### The second viewing

The first viewing is to get you acquainted with the house. You’re making a million-dollar investment – go see it again, or even a third time to really understand the property. Take family, take friends, get differing opinions and debate. I strongly urge you to visit a serious property at-least three times before raising your hand at auction or signing an offer document. Do a private viewing if you don’t want to deal with open homes.

### Turn off the lights on a dark day

At open homes you will notice all the lights are on. The best open homes are the ones where the weather is atrocious outside. Go when it's raining heavily, and turn off the lights across the house to see what it feels like. Good houses let in lots of natural light even on bleak days. The badly thought out ones make you feel like you're part of a sad Auckland housing story.

### Wear socks!

Ok this one is just me - remember you are in someone's home, but also hundreds of people are walking through it. You may want to wear socks unless you like to live dangerously.&#x20;
