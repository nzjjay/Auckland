# Viewing a property

### The drive-by

A hot hack I have between shortlisting and viewing properties, is the drive-by. I stack the 5-10 houses I have on the shortlist, and simply drive to each of them in one go to see if I like the look of the house, street and area. You'll be surprised at how many houses can get knocked off your list just by doing this. Common reasons for me include being next to power pylons, a townhouse development happening next door, and just the "vibe" of the street - trust your gut.

## The viewing

Whether or not you do a drive-by, homes will have open homes between 11am - 3pm on weekends, or can be viewed by appointment. Stating the obvious, but DO NOT ever consider buying a house without seeing it in person. Do not hesitate to message agents asking for private viewings, or to spend a considerable amount of time at a property. You will learn that after a while you can cover houses in about 15 minutes.

Personally, I prefer open homes because it lets you see what other people are noticing – I once saw a few people staring intently at the bathroom ceiling, drawing my attention to the lack of an extractor fan and subsequent mould formation!

### Open homes

Open homes are just that. Show up at the allocated time, sign your name in (this is required to help agents with security - things can get stolen), and roam around.&#x20;

### Private viewing / by appointment

Feel welcome to request a private viewing from the listing agent. Most will be happy to oblige and will give you a private tour of the property, or open the doors and tell you to have at it.&#x20;

### Your lifestyle

It’s really important to picture how you’ll live your daily life in the property—let’s be honest, that’s what you’ll be doing most of the time. You won’t be entertaining friends every day; you'll be working, caring for kids, cleaning, and doing all the regular stuff. So, focus on the everyday practicality of the property rather than the flashy “special appeals.”

Think about the trade-offs too. A large piece of land may be great for kids to run around, but it also means mowing the lawn every couple of weeks during summer. Is that something you’re comfortable with?

Transport is another big factor. If you work in the city, how close is the bus stop, and how long will the commute take? If you drive, is it easy to get to your car in the pouring rain during Auckland’s winter, and can you easily exit onto the road? Also, in a shared driveway situation, can you wash your car without bothering the neighbors? These everyday considerations should play a big role in your decision.

**Story:** I purchased a 1080sqm land, 280sqm house property in Mount Roskill, it was great for the first year before it dawned on me how much time I spent just cleaning, mowing, weeding, pruning and painting. I am still very happy with what I got, but I am more mindful about wishful lifestyles vs the reality of a corporate job, family life, and needing to spend the weekends cleaning and gardening....

### The second viewing

The first viewing is just to get a feel for the house. This is a big investment—don’t rush it! I strongly recommend visiting the property at least two or three more times before committing, whether it’s for an auction or signing an offer. Take family and friends along to get different perspectives and have some debates. It’s crucial to fully understand the property before making such a significant decision. If you want a quieter experience, schedule a private viewing to avoid the crowd at open homes.

### Turn off the lights on a dark day

At open homes, the lights are always on to make the house look brighter. To really assess the space, visit when the weather is bad—preferably during heavy rain—and turn off the lights. This will give you a sense of how much natural light the house gets. A good house should feel bright and welcoming even on the gloomiest days. A poorly designed home, on the other hand, will make you feel like you're trapped in a dreary Auckland housing story.

### Wear socks!

Okay, this one’s just my personal preference: wear socks! You’re walking through someone else’s home, and with so many people going through it, you might prefer to keep things hygienic and avoid going barefoot. Plus, it’s just safer unless you’re into living dangerously!
