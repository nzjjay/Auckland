# Viewing a property

## Viewing a Property

Once you’ve shortlisted properties, the next step is **viewing them in person**. This is where you truly start to understand what a property offers — beyond the photos, listing descriptions, and floor plans.

### The drive-by

A quick hack I use between shortlisting and viewing is the **drive-by**. Stack 5–10 shortlisted houses and drive past each one in one go to check:

* The street vibe
* Neighbouring properties
* Surrounding developments

You’ll be surprised how many houses can get knocked off your list just by doing this. Common reasons for me include power pylons, new townhouse developments next door, or just the **overall vibe** of the street — trust your gut.

### The viewing

Whether you do a drive-by or not, seeing a house in person is important (stating the obvious). Open homes usually run from 11am–3pm on weekends, but private viewings can be arranged by appointment. Never buy a house without seeing it yourself.

* **Open homes:** Show up at the allocated time, speak to the agent, and roam around. Observing other visitors can be enlightening — you might notice things you hadn’t considered, like a bathroom ceiling without an extractor fan or signs of mould.
* **Private viewings:** Request a private tour if you want more time or a quieter experience. Most listing agents are happy to oblige.

### Consider your lifestyle

When viewing, picture **your daily life** in the property. Focus on practicality over flashy features. Consider:

* **Maintenance trade-offs:** A large section is great for kids but means mowing, weeding, and gardening. Are you comfortable with that?
* **Transport:** If you commute, how easy is access to public transport or your car? In shared driveways, can you park and maintain your vehicle without inconveniencing neighbours?
* **Daily routines:** Think about working, cooking, cleaning, and caring for family — not just entertaining.

**Personal story:** I bought a 1080sqm section with a 280sqm house in Mount Roskill. It was fantastic for the first year, until reality set in — weekends disappeared to mowing, weeding, pruning, and painting. I’m happy with the property, but I now weigh “wishful lifestyle” against the reality of corporate life and family commitments.

### The second viewing

The first viewing is just to **get a feel** for the property. This is a big investment — don’t rush it. I recommend:

* Visiting the property **two to three more times** before committing
* Taking family or friends along for different perspectives
* Scheduling private viewings for a quieter, focused assessment

### Assessing the light

Open homes always have the lights on. To truly gauge natural light:

* Visit on a **gloomy or rainy day**
* Turn off the lights to see how bright the house feels naturally

A good property should feel welcoming even on the dreariest Auckland day. If it feels dark or oppressive, it may not be the right fit.

### Other tips

* **Wear socks:** Walking through someone else’s home is hygienically easier with socks, and it’s safer than going barefoot in a crowded open home.

***

Viewing a property is about combining **gut feeling, practicality, and lifestyle considerations**. Use multiple visits, consider your daily routines, and trust your instincts — this is the step where you begin to feel whether a home will truly suit you for the next few years
