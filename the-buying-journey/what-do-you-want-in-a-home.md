# What do you want in a home

Searching for and shortlisting properties is one of the first things you'll be doing. To do this, you'll need to form a view of what you want.

## Look around to see what you like

Start your search and shortlist stage by doing a drive-around (or walk) in neighborhoods you're interested in, take note of what you like and don't like. Visit a few open homes with a totally open mind just to get a sense of what you "vibe" with and don't. Soon, you'll start to form a view of what you must have, should have, and could have in a home. A rough idea is fine.

You can also browse property websites like Trademe Property and homes.co.nz to get a view of properties on the market, what they're selling for, and just get a general sense of the property market to form your views.

## Write down what you must and could haves.

Once you've formed a view of what you want, write it down on a piece of paper with bullet points. This is going to serve you well over your search. This may change as you search more, but it's totally fine. Over time, you may start getting desperate when properties don't meet your needs or in the price range, and you'll start to try compromise on this list. I have conflicting thoughts on this - in some cases you may genuinely need to reset your own expectations, but in other cases, be fair and firm - this is your biggest purchase yet, and you'll spend most of your life for the next few years within it, so don't compromise.

Remember, always write the _why_ next to your shortlist, so you can always reflect on why it's there in the first place, it's a good idea in case you want to take something off the list.

This is how I wrote mine:

**Jay's first home property shortlist**

* Less than 5 minutes' walk to rapid public transit
  * Because I spent 1.5hrs going to work each way in the city and never want to experience that ever again.
  * So I can drink with mates on Friday night and not pay for overpriced Ubers home because buses still run.
* A big garage or basement
  * Because I like DIY and enjoy my car, so want a secure storage area.
* Elevated
  * Because I want plenty of natural light
  * To reduce risk of flooding
* 400sqm - 600sqm land
  * Some land to create a buffer with the neighbours
  * Not too much to reduce the lawn mowing
* 3-4 Bedrooms
  * So, we can plan for the future family

With this shortlist, you can quickly start&#x20;
