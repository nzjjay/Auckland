# Why?

## Why do you want to buy?

The first thing you need to answer for yourself is your reasoning to buy a house. Is it so you don’t need to rent anymore? To diversify your investments? To plan for a family? To develop it now or in the future? There can be several reasons, but you should have one main reason which will and should greatly influence your purchasing requirements.

## What do you want from your property?

There’s a reason you’re looking for a property. Write down what you’re looking for, and make sure your significant other or buying partner agrees. Decide on a few key characteristics all properties you look at should have. These can change over time as you get familiar with the market.

Common requirements include proximity to public transport, amenities, school zones, style of house, and number of bedrooms it should have.

## How much do you want to pay?

Properties cost money, and ultimately this is a financial transaction. Although we may have ideas on how much we want to pay, most buying decisions will eventually center around how much a bank is willing to lend you. A common mistake is to create a budget – this won’t work well in the reality of Auckland housing. The better option is to get a pre-approval through a mortgage broker or bank. &#x20;

### What areas do you want to consider?

Auckland is vast, and different areas suit different lifestyles and personalities. From the North Shore beaches, West Auckland wilderness, East Auckland’s suburbia, Central Auckland bustle, or South Auckland’s affordability, there’s plenty of suburbs and choices to fit your budget and lifestyle.

You will quickly get overwhelmed searching across Auckland, so instead, focus on certain suburbs or traits that fit within your budget and lifestyle, and focus deeply in the area.
