# Buying instead of renting

## The math doesn't work out buying instead of renting

There are several benefits to owning a house instead of renting one to live in, but I want to dispel the theory that owning a house is financially better than renting - this is my opinion only, but here's my take:

Example: A $1 Million entry level / first home buyer property in Mount Roskill. The rental valuation on these is usually around $800 a week, **so $41,600 a year is what we target for break-even.**

So on a $1M property, at 20% LVR, you are required to pay a 20% deposit, and the bank will lend you 80%. Therefore, the following applies:

1. Borrowing 800K @ 6% = $48,000
2. Sacrificing investing 200K @ 4% = $8000 (before tax)

Therefore, by choosing to invest your money in the house and borrow to buy the house, you are paying **$56,000** a year (the cost of interest on 800K + the cost of not earning interest on the 200K).

Then add-on mandatory rates, insurance, and home maintenance (let's say 7k all up), you'll be paying $63,000 a year, in the first year, give or take, for your home. This means you're better off by $20,000 a year to rent. How much do you hate your landlord?

Now over time the biggest cost (interest) will reduce but remember that it's your savings you are putting into the house, so in theory you'd invest this instead of having the mortgage, let's assume you put it into term deposits at 4%.

1. 1M @ 4% = $40,000, $28.8K after tax at 28% PIE rate.
2. $7000 for rates, insurance, and maintenance.
3. Total cost = $47K

In this best-case scenario, you're still paying $47K a year in forgone interest on savings and mandatory outgoings, compared to the $42K or so you'd pay renting.

### Caveats

There's a lot of assumptions here, this assumes no capital appreciation, that rents don't increase, etc. However, remember depreciation is a thing as well (just ask anyone that purchased in 2021 trying to sell in 2024), and other costs go up (just ask the Mayor of Auckland how rates are going). So this is very back of the napkin math.

## It's not the financials you need to consider

In writing all this, owning your home has several benefits, and the emotional side of it matters the most, for example:

1. The feeling of owning your own home...
2. Being able to buy furniture that's just perfect, because you won't ever need to move out.
3. Renovating your home to your desires...
4. Not living in anxiety of being kicked out after a year / 60 days notice.
5. Not being totally surprised by rent increases.
6. Not worrying about moving around, and the stability that comes with a location.

Long story short, if you are buying because you don't want to rent anymore, it's not the financials you should be relying on for why.
