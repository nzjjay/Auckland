# Your buying journey

This guide is structured so that you can read it end-to-end, or refer back to it for guidance when you need it. There's three parts to buying a house:

1. The process involving the sale and purchase of a property
2. The overall property
3. The building itself
4. The financials, legals, and paperwork involved

My advice would be to read section one now to get your head in the game, two & three when you're more serious about a property, and four when you're ready to make an offer. &#x20;

The buying journey will vary - patience is key. Sometimes you'll get lucky and find your perfect property first time, other times you'll be searching for upwards of 9 months.&#x20;
