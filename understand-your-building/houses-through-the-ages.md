# Houses through the ages

The age of a building is a major factor in its price, condition, and future maintenance. Auckland has had a checkered history with certain building materials, and the legacy of leaky homes still impacts buyer sentiment and insurance. Understanding the era of a home helps you anticipate issues and budget accordingly.

## Pre 1900s

Houses built before 1900 are typically small, wooden, cold, and damp, unless they were luxury homes. Most are located in inner suburbs and have often been renovated over time.

* **Considerations:**
  * Insurance can be tricky – many companies require a full building report.
  * Expect to invest in ongoing maintenance, including roofing, plumbing, and wiring upgrades.
  * Character homes may have heritage overlays, which restrict exterior changes.
* **Tips:**
  * Look for evidence of previous renovations and maintenance.
  * Pay attention to timber condition and the potential for borer infestations.
  * A building inspection is essential – REFER TO CHARACTER BUILDING CHECKLIST.

## 1900 – 1945

These houses are often wooden and built with traditional Kiwi craftsmanship. Many are located in special character suburbs such as Grey Lynn, Ponsonby, and Herne Bay.

* **Considerations:**
  * Renovations are likely, but structural elements like roofs and subfloor cavities may still be original.
  * Insurance companies may require evidence of re-roofing, re-wiring, re-plumbing, or even re-piling.
  * Borer and moisture damage remain risks.
* **Tips:**
  * Include a building report in your conditions of sale.
  * Factor renovation costs into your offer.
  * Consider heritage overlays when planning exterior work.

## 1945 – 1970

The post-war boom produced a large proportion of Auckland’s housing stock. Materials were often cheaper, and plumbing standards varied widely.

* **Considerations:**
  * Many houses used the infamous Dux Quest black plumbing, which can cause leaks.
  * Roofs, wiring, and foundations may be due for updates.
  * While issues exist, most homes are structurally sound if maintained.
* **Tips:**
  * A building inspection is highly recommended, especially for plumbing and drainage.
  * Cosmetic updates may be needed to modernize kitchens, bathrooms, and interiors.

## 1970 – 2000

This era saw improved building standards and construction methods, but also the introduction of plasterboard and stucco cladding, which contributed to the leaky home problems of the early 2000s.

* **Considerations:**
  * Homes are generally solid but may need cosmetic updates.
  * Watch for plasterboard or stucco on areas exposed to moisture, particularly in roofs, decks, and balconies.
  * Older homes in this era may not meet modern insulation or glazing standards.
* **Tips:**
  * Check the building report carefully for cladding or moisture issues.
  * Consider upgrades to insulation, heating, or energy efficiency.

## 2000 Onwards

Modern houses benefit from stricter building codes and better materials, including timber framing, brick, and aluminium joinery.

* **Considerations:**
  * Most homes are low-risk structurally.
  * Some properties may still use single glazing, though newer homes use mandatory double glazing.
  * Building inspections are still recommended to catch minor defects.
* **Tips:**
  * Focus inspections on warranties, finishes, and compliance with recent codes.
  * Pay attention to insulation, ventilation, and any innovative or non-standard features.
