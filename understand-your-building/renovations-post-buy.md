# Renovations post buy

The best time to renovate a house is when you first move in. You likely already have somewhere to stay, and the house is empty, so there’s minimal disruption to your life. In the excitement of buying a first home, the temptation will be to move in straight-away (which is fine too). If finances allow, and you have the time, energy, etc, consider what aspects you’d want to change and plan in advance. Kitchens, bathrooms and bedrooms are great candidates for “pre-move in” renovations.

The other thing to note is when looking at older properties, strong bones with “unkept” rooms presents a great opportunity to create a room that suits your taste without feeling bad about ripping out existing features. I use this pricing rule:

The price I’d pay if the house was “ideal” – the cost of renovation to get to that point = The price I’d be willing to pay today.

It is hard to predict how much renovations will cost because it will vary based on the property and spec, but in general, I budget the following:

·        Kitchens: 20-30K (Flooring, cupboards, sink, appliances, rangehoods, countertops).

·        Bathrooms: 10-30K (Flooring, waterproofing, vanity, shower, toilet, etc).

·        Bedrooms: 5K (Flooring, electrical, insulation).

·        Exterior Painting: 12K (Roof + Weatherboards).
