# Roofing and Gutters

## Roofing

The roof is very important and this site explains it better than I can: [https://www.manorbuild.co.nz/blog/different-roof-style-options-explained](https://www.manorbuild.co.nz/blog/different-roof-style-options-explained)&#x20;

### Metal / Coloursteel

These are common and very popular – most weatherboard houses and older villas use this. Lightweight, low maintenance and looks good. When buying, take a quick look at the roofing – make sure there’s no rust, and all the roof nails look like they’re in. A builder will check a bit more in-depth, but that’s no excuse for you to not look at it too.

### Tiles

Concrete or clay tiles are very popular. Tiles are also very durable and long lasting, requiring little maintenance. They’re also good in windy locations. Check for broken or cracked tiles – these can indicate something far more serious and is one for your builder to check.

## Guttering

### External Gutters

External guttering is where the gutter hangs at the edge of the roof and is easily accessible. On a rainy day, check and make sure water is not overflowing from the gutters.

### Internal Gutters

Internal gutters are where the gutter is not exposed and contained within the building. It usually makes the house look a lot nicer subjectively. The problem is when things go wrong - it can be a very expensive fix. My strong advice is to go with the common and easy option of external gutter properties. This article is technical, but explains how an internal gutter works: [https://www.buildmagazine.org.nz/assets/PDF/Build-143-34-Design-Right-Internal-Gutters.pdf](https://www.buildmagazine.org.nz/assets/PDF/Build-143-34-Design-Right-Internal-Gutters.pdf)&#x20;
