# The character building checklist

During the first home buyer search, all of us fall in love with at least one heritage villa in Mt Eden (or similar). The house will be painted in Epsom white, have high ceilings, and will make you feel like the 1900s royalty you are. These houses are beautiful in their own right, but you need to be aware of a few things when you visit them, for insurance and quality of house purposes. Call it the “REs”.

| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Re-Roofed  | <p>The house should have been re-roofed since original construction and comply with modern building codes. Iron roofs have a life expectancy of 30 years. If the house hasn’t been re-roofed, make sure you get a careful inspection done. Most insurance companies expect it.</p><p> </p>                                                             | $10,000 - $20,000                |
| Re-Wired   | <p>The house should have been re-wired to comply with modern electrical standards and loads. Older houses were not built to withstand the electrical loads we place on them, and this presents a fire risk. If you really like the house, call an electrician to confirm the house is safe for modern electrical standards.</p><p> </p>                | $3,500 - $10,000                 |
| Re-Plumbed | Not a major concern for older houses with copper pipes, and this actually relates to renovations done to the house where the piping has been replaced with dux quest. Check and make sure the plumbing is solid.                                                                                                                                       | $4,000 - $5,000                  |
| Re-Piled   | <p>Older houses will sit on piles that meet the standards of the 1900s, and may be in a bad state (rotten, slanted, becoming dust). The house should have been re-piled, or the builder should certify that the piles are in a good state. Most insurance companies expect the property to be re-piled. This is not for the faint hearted.</p><p> </p> | $25,000 - $50,000                |
| Re-Lined   | The house should have been re-lined to ensure there is no scrim on the walls. Scrim presents a fire-risk, and a lack of re-lining also indicates a lack of re-wiring and plumbing. If the house has not been re-lined, it is a very expensive project.                                                                                                 | <p>$10,000 - $20,000</p><p> </p> |
